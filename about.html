           <div class="welcome">Your home could be your most valuable asset as well as your largest single monthly expense. These resources will help you manage the process.  Think about how much money you have available to make your down payment.
           Figure out how much you can reasonably pay each month for your mortgage, property taxes and homeowners insurance. This number will normally be the size of the check you will have to write each month as your mortgage payment, and it will give you an idea of how large a loan you may be able to support. Keep in mind that many lenders expect your monthly payment to be less than some specific percentage limit, often 28&#45;33 percent of your gross monthly income.
           Estimate what your mortgage principal and interest payments would be, remembering that for any given interest rate, a longer-term loan will cost you less each month but add up to more total cost in the long run.  Look carefully at the real estate taxes for the property, homeowner&#39;s insurance costs, add up all utilities you&#39;re likely to need, and budget for secondary costs.  <br><br>  Determine payoff amounts for all loans tied to your property, identify any liens for items such as unpaid taxes, mechanic&#39;s liens and unsatisfied judgments, and Estimate transaction-related costs such as sales commissions and fees, legal and advisory fees and the costs of preparing the property for sale. Determine whether you might be in a seller&#39;s market or a buyer&#39;s market. Indicators include a rising (or falling) number of listings in your area, how quickly an average home stays on the market before it is sold and whether the average house is selling at a significant discount from its listing price. Evaluate the impact of nearby development activity. Among the projects that could have an impact are new industrial parks, shopping malls, schools, and hospital or medical facilities. Keep in mind that new facilities could attract some potential buyers while deterring others, and Consider the potential effects of nearby mass transit and highway construction projects. See what nearby homes have sold for in recent months. You should focus on those most similar in size and quality to yours.  Comparison shop to see the homes that might be competing with yours for potential buyers&#39; attention.
