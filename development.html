            <h3> VISTA AVENUE </h3>
                
            <p>Architecture by Scott Siekert Design, LLC and construction by Chouteau Building Group, Vista Place is a quality design and 
            construction. It's a unique single-family development planned for area known as The Grove.  This distinguishing four-unit single family development in The Grove has received an endorsement for tax abatement from the Park Central Development Corporation. Planned for 4310 Vista, across from Adams Elementary, the project has added a unit and moved east a few lots from its original proposal.  Not only does the project demonstrate belief in demand for market-rate housing south of Manchester, it introduces a new and interesting housing form to the city. The equivalent of four narrow city lots will see four homes, two behind two facing Vista, and detached four-car garage.  Each home will own the land around it, with common ownership of the central courtyard and vegetable garden. The arrangement allows, not only the sharing of amenities and parking, but a different house form, avoiding the constraint of the typical 25ft-wide lot.<br>
            <b>PRE-CONSTRUCTION:</b> buyers can choose from 4 floor plans and customized finishes without incurring add-on charges.  <br> <b>BASE PRICING INCLUDES</b> quality features such as European kitchen/bath cabinetry with quartz counter tops, customized smart home technology, wide plank wood floors, Kohler bath fixtures, private terraces &amp; 10’ ceilings. Vista Place is a condominium collection of 4  single family homes and 2 lofts. </p>
